# Artzy (Etsy-Clone)

Welcome to Artzy, my full-stack development project, inspired by the creativity of Etsy. This platform, which combines a JavaScript/React frontend with a Python/Flask backend, showcases my skills in both intuitive front-end design and efficient back-end development.
This project not only reflects my ability to create visually engaging interfaces but also demonstrates my proficiency in managing complex backend operations.

Experience the fusion of art and technology, a testament to my coding expertise [artzy](https://google.com)
